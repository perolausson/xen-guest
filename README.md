xen-guest
=========

This is a role for creating guests on a Xen hypervisor which can then immediately be used to perform Ansible actions on, in the same Ansible playbook run.

Requirements
------------

* Ansible dig (dnspython from pip and dig from your distribution; Ansible 1.9+)

Tested on
---------

* Ubuntu 17.04
* Ansible 2.4
* Xen Hypervisor 4.8
* Xen-tools 4.7-1

Dependencies
------------

* A working Xen hypervisor installation with xen-tools installed
* There is a DHCP server which also updates DNS with any new hosts

Description
-----------

The role uses xen-tools/xen-create-image to create new guests.

The method of installation can be specified, which means that is possible to install debian/ubuntu or centos/fedora guests but the latter is dependent on support in xen-tools.

Unfortunately the latest centos support in Xen-tools is centos-6.

There are issues to be aware of which has not been solved, such as feature levels in filesystems you create are dependent on the feature levels in your hypervisor.

For example, creating older releases might not boot up because the filesystem created by xen-create-image is newer and has features an older Linux distribution doesn't know about.

What happens when you run through the role?

 - copy across SSH authorised keys so that we can log into the new guest without passwords (password is however displayed during the run)
 - clean up and delete any old guest with the same name if they exist and overwrite is specified
 - create the guest image
 - create the guest
 - start the guest and wait for it to come online
 - remove/add SSH fingerprints for the old/new guest
 - add the guest to the in-memory inventory
 - prepare the host for Ansible operations (install python-minimal)

TODO:

* Add permanent inventory updates, currently only in-memory updates are done after the new guest has been prepared for Ansible use.

Example Playbook for creating a Xenial guest and install apache on it
---------------------------------------------------------------------
    
     ---
      - hosts: forester   # change this to the host where your Xen hypervisor is running
        roles:
          - role: xen-guest
            name: zeus2
            overwrite: true
   
      - hosts: zeus2.lan
        tasks:

          - name: Ping the new guest
            ping:

          - name: Setup
            setup: filter=ansible_eth[0-2]

          - name: Install Apache2
            package:
              name: apache2
              state: latest
