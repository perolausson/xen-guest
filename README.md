xen-guest
=========

This is a role for creating guests on a Xen hypervisor which can then immediately be used to perform Ansible actions on, in the same Ansible playbook run.

The role uses xen-tools/xen-create-image to create new guests and it is possible to specify the method used.

This means you can install debian/ubuntu or centos/fedora guests but the latter is dependent on support in xen-tools. Unfortunately the latest centos support is centos-6.

There are issues to be aware of which has not been solved, such as feature levels in filesystems you create are dependent on the feature levels in your hypervisor.

For example, creating older releases might not boot up because the filesystem created by xen-create-image is newer and has features an older Linux distribution doesn't know about.

What happens when you run through the role?

 - copy across SSH authorised keys so that we can log into the new guest without passwords (password is however displayed during the run)
 - clean up and delete any old guest with the same name if they exist and overwrite is specified
 - create the guest image
 - create the guest
 - start the guest and wait for it to come online
 - remove/add SSH fingerprints for the old/new guest
 - add the guest to the in-memory inventory
 - prepare the host for Ansible operations (install python-minimal)

TODO:

* Add permanent inventory updates, currently only in-memory updates are done after the new guest has been prepared for Ansible use.

Requirements
------------

Ansible dig (dnspython from pip and dig from your distribution; Ansible 1.9+)
A working Xen hypervisor installation with xen-tools installed
There is a DHCP server which also updates DNS with any new hosts

  overwrite	false		overwrite and replace an existing guest with the same name

Example Playbook for creating a Xenial guest and install apache on it
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 ---
  - hosts: forester   # change this to the host where your Xen hypervisor is running
    roles:
      - role: xen-guest
        name: zeus2
        overwrite: true
   
  - hosts: zeus2.lan
    tasks:

      - name: Ping the new guest
        ping:

      - name: Setup
        setup: filter=ansible_eth[0-2]

      - name: Install Apache2
        package:
          name: apache2
          state: latest
